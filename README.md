# Friendly Faces (Front End)
This is the front end code for my first full stack web app: Friendly Faces.

Check out the back end code: <a href="https://github.com/Preston-Young/friendly-faces" target="_blank">https://github.com/Preston-Young/friendly-faces</a>

Check out the final product: <a href="https://friendlyfaces.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://friendlyfaces.herokuapp.com/</a> <br />
(Note: When visiting the website for the first time, it will take a while to load, but every visit after will be much quicker because Chrome will cache the dependencies)

## Summary
This is the first full stack web I've built on my journey to teaching myself web development. Friendly Faces utilizes the Clarifai API to allow registered users to detect faces in photos that registered users upload. Creating this projects helped to solidify my understanding of how front end technologies interact with back end servers and databases. For the front end, I leveraged React to create the web pages and reuable components. Using JavaScript promises, I communicated with my back end server to obtain any necessary user information I needed to display on the front end. For the styling, I used a combination of my own CSS and the npm tachyons library.

## Things I want to improve on
* Add better error messages/alerts when the user fails to register or log in
* Add more requirements for the password length, special characters, etc.
* Detect multiple faces
* Add ability to change forgotten password
